    <p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION</p>

    <ol>
        <li><p>Definitions.</p>

            <p>“License” shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, <br>
                and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.</p>

            <p>“Licensor” shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by <br>
                the copyright owner that is granting the License.</p>

            <p>“Legal Entity” shall mean the union of the acting entity and all <br>
                other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common <br>
                control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, <br>
                “control” means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the <br>
                direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or <br>
                otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the <br>
                outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.</p>

            <p>“You” (or “Your”) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity <br>
                exercising permissions granted by this License.</p>

            <p>“Source” form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, <br>
                including but not limited to software source code, documentation <br>
                source, and configuration files.</p>

            <p>“Object” form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical <br>
                transformation or translation of a Source form, including but <br>
                not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, <br>
                and conversions to other media types.</p>

            <p>“Work” shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or <br>
                Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a <br>
                copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work <br>
                (an example is provided in the Appendix below).</p>

            <p>“Derivative Works” shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object <br>
                form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the <br>
                editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications <br>
                represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes <br>
                of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain <br>
                separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, <br>
                the Work and Derivative Works thereof.</p>

            <p>“Contribution” shall mean any work of authorship, including <br>
                the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions <br>
                to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally <br>
                submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner <br>
                or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of <br>
                the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, “submitted” <br>
                means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent <br>
                to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to <br>
                communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, <br>
                and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the <br>
                Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but <br>
                excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise <br>
                designated in writing by the copyright owner as “Not a Contribution.”</p>

            <p>“Contributor” shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity <br>
                on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and <br>
                subsequently incorporated within the Work.</p></li>
        <li><p>Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of <br>
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, <br>
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable <br>
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, <br>
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the <br>
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p></li>
        <li><p>Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of <br>
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, <br>
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable <br>
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, <br>
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, <br>
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable <br>
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their <br>
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) <br>
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You <br>
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a <br>
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work <br>
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct <br>
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses <br>
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate <br>
            as of the date such litigation is filed.</p></li>
        <li><p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the <br>
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without <br>
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You <br>
            meet the following conditions:</p>

            <p>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or <br>
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>

            <p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices <br>
                stating that You changed the files; and</p>

            <p>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works <br>
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and <br>
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, <br>
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of <br>
                the Derivative Works; and</p>

            <p>(d) If the Work includes a “NOTICE” text file as part of its <br>
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must <br>
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained <br>
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not <br>
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one <br>
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed <br>
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or <br>
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, <br>
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and <br>
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents <br>
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and <br>
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution <br>
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside <br>
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided <br>
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed <br>
                as modifying the License.</p>

            <p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and <br>
                may provide additional or different license terms and conditions <br>
                for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or <br>
                for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, <br>
                reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with <br>
                the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>
        <li><p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, <br>
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work <br>
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of <br>
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions. <br>
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify <br>
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed <br>
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p></li>
        <li><p>Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade <br>
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, <br>
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the <br>
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p></li>
        <li><p>Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or <br>
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each <br>
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an “AS IS” BASIS, <br>
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or <br>
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions <br>
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A <br>
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the <br>
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any <br>
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p></li>
        <li><p>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, <br>
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, <br>
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly <br>
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be <br>
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, <br>
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a <br>
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the <br>
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, <br>
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all <br>
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor <br>
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>
        <li><p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing <br>
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, <br>
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, <br>
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this <br>
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only <br>
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf <br>
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, <br>
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability <br>
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason <br>
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

            <p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

            <p>APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.</p>

            <p>To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following <br>
                boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets “{}” <br>

                the brackets!) The text should be enclosed in the appropriate <br>
                comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a <br>
                file or class name and description of purpose be included on the <br>
                same “printed page” as the copyright notice for easier <br>
                identification within third-party archives.</p>
